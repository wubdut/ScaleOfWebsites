# ScaleOfWebsites
crale the scale of websites

This is a python crawler to get the number of pages of one websites. I want to study crawler which implements on distributed system such as hadoop. So,  it is the beginning.

I got this idea from a inerview for a internship of Google. Although I failed, the interviewer taught me how to write a crowler to get the number of pages of a website. 

I am so sad about the loss, which motivates me a lot to write this crowler.
