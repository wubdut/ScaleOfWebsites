# ScaleOfWebsites
crawl the scale of websites

This is a python crawler to get the number of pages of one website. I want to study crawler which implements on distributed system such as hadoop. So,  it is the beginning.

I got this idea from a interview for a internship of Google. Although I failed, the interviewer taught me how to write a crowler to get the number of pages of a website in an hour.

I am so sad about the loss, which motivates me a lot to write this crawler.
